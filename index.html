        <h2>Pressure Calculation</h2>
        <p>Pressure is defined as the force applied per unit area. The formula to calculate pressure is:</p>
        <p><strong>Pressure (P) = Force (F) / Area (A)</strong></p>
        <div class="calculator">
            <label for="force">Force (N):</label>
            <input type="number" id="force" value="10">
            <label for="area">Area (m²):</label>
            <input type="number" id="area" value="2">
            <button onclick="calculatePressure()">Calculate</button>

        <h2>Fundamental Concepts of Pressure</h2>

        <h3>1. Definition of Pressure</h3>
        <p>Pressure is the ratio of the force applied perpendicularly to the surface of an object to the area over which the force is distributed. The SI unit of pressure is the Pascal (Pa), where 1 Pa equals 1 Newton per square meter (N/m²).</p>

        <h3>2. Types of Pressure</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Atmospheric Pressure:</strong> The pressure exerted by the Earth's atmosphere at sea level is approximately 101,325 Pascals (Pa).</li>
            <li><strong>Gauge Pressure:</strong> The pressure measured relative to atmospheric pressure.</li>
            <li><strong>Absolute Pressure:</strong> The total pressure measured, including atmospheric pressure.</li>
            <li><strong>Fluid Pressure:</strong> The pressure exerted by a fluid in motion or at rest, often governed by Bernoulli's and Pascal’s laws.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Boyle's Law</h3>
        <p>Boyle's Law states that the pressure of a given mass of gas is inversely proportional to its volume at a constant temperature. Mathematically, it is expressed as:</p>
        <p><strong>P₁V₁ = P₂V₂</strong></p>
        <p>Where P is pressure and V is volume. As the volume of a gas decreases, its pressure increases, provided the temperature remains constant.</p>

        <h3>4. Pascal’s Law</h3>
        <p>Pascal's Law states that a change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished to all parts of the fluid and to the walls of its container. This principle is the foundation for hydraulic systems, such as brakes and lifts.</p>

        <h3>5. Bernoulli's Principle</h3>
        <p>Bernoulli's Principle states that for a fluid flowing in a streamline, the pressure decreases as its velocity increases. This principle helps explain the behavior of fluid in pipes, the lift force on airplane wings, and the functioning of carburetors.</p>
